# Logo for first screen (above Login button)

**File to add:** `zwilling_logo.png`

**Location:** Save your Zwilling Labs logo in this folder:
- Path: `assets/images/zwilling_logo.png`
- The logo (blue rounded square with white Z, black "Zwilling Labs" text) is shown above the Login button on the first screen.

If the file is missing, the app shows the text "Zwilling Labs" as a fallback.
